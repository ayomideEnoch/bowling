It's hard to believe summer is almost over already, but here we are.  Most of our leagues are already up and running!  We have some changes coming this year, with our new look website and moving the annual tournament earlier in the bowling season.  We have a meeting coming up this Saturday, September 7th, to discuss the tournament and pick a charity for our annual fundraiser.  We will keep you posted after we get all the details.  If you have any comments or suggestions, send us a message on \[facebook](https://www.facebook.com/SouthernNewHampshireUSBC).  Good luck and high scores this year!
