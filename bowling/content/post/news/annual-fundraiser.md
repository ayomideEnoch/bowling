<p>We are proud to announce that we have chosen the Northern New England Chapter of the ALS Association as this year's charity for our annual fundraiser!  The football squares were such a hit last year we have decided to bring them back this year.  Thanks to all the bowlers for your support.  Here is some information about the ALS association.</p>
