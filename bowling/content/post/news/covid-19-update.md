<p>Hello Bowlers.  We all hope you are doing well in these tough times.  We have been told today that Funspot,
Keene and Manchester bowling centers will be closed at this time.  SNHUSBC has also decided to cancel the annual 
meeting this year.  As of right now, we do not have information about what will happen with the leagues or when
the bowling centers will reopen.  If you have any questions, please <a href = "https://snhusbc.com/contact/"> click here</a>
and fill out the form to reach out to us.  </p>
<p>Thank you for your understanding.  We will post new information on the website as we get it.  We wish you all the best.</p>
