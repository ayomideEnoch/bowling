<p>Hello Bowlers.  We all hope you are doing well in these tough times.  Due to the recent restrictions put in place by the state all bowling alleys are closed until May 4th.  As of right now, we do not have information about what will happen with the leagues or when the bowling centers will reopen.  If you have any questions, please <a href = "https://snhusbc.com/contact/"> click here</a> and fill out the form to reach out to us.  </p>
<p>Thank you for your understanding.  We will post new information on the website as we get it.  We wish you all the best.</p>
